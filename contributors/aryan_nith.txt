About Me

I am a full-stack web developer and engineering student with strong expertise in modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I enjoy building clean, scalable, and user-centric web applications, with a strong focus on performance, maintainable architecture, and real-world usability.

I have hands-on experience in backend development using Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, along with implementing authentication, role-based access control, and payment gateway integrations. I have also worked with Socket.IO for real-time features, API integrations, and modern deployment workflows.

Additionally, I have practical exposure to Python and data-focused libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, and have applied them in analytical and prediction-based projects. I actively participate in hackathons and open-source contributions and enjoy solving complex problems through clean and efficient code.

I am passionate about continuous learning, strengthening my problem-solving and system design skills, and contributing to impactful, scalable, and meaningful projects.
